When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on something in a group or working on something large

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Commits mat be added at intervals, if automatically done, the work may not be pulled at the correct point.
  May pull something that isn't fully completed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Clone is where you directly copy across work from someone elses.
  Fork is where you can work on someone else,s work and add your own changes.
  Branch is where you can work on code separately to the master and add your own changes and then merge it back into master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  So that all files are upto date and you are always working on the most recent code
